D3-OpenLayers
==============

Getting started with D3 for drawing circles based on simple data.

Prerequisites:
--------------
Have python and npm installed.


The openlayers lib is already included in vendor.

Steps:
------
You should have 'bower' installed. If not you can install it using 'npm install bower -g'.

Clone the repo and cd into the repo.

bower install

python -m SimpleHTTPServer 9988

And go to localhost:9988
